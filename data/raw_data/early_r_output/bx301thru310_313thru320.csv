I recommend that this species NOT be grown in frost free areas because it is very fecund and could become invasive. Sow seeds thinly because most seeds germinate and since most of the plant is below ground, the pot will get too crowded very fast. The flashy orange leaf bases will develop after the first year."

It was listed by the RHS as last being commercially available in 2005. The term 'gib' was a mystery to me, and originally I thought it to be an alternate spelling of a 'jib' sail. Google told me that a 'gib' is a castrated male cat or ferret. No thanks, but it also told me that 'gib' is short for Gibraltar. Stocken also collected in the Ronda mountains of Spain, and Gibraltar is just to the south, so is the probable origin of these bulbs. As for the bulb itself, it has never bloomed for me in ~8 years, but has multiplied like crazy. It has received the summer treatment recommended for plain old 'Stockens', but to no avail.
