BX 338||From Monica Swartz: 
BX 338||||1||Seed of|Schizobasis intricata, ex Huntington Botanic Gardens (ISI 2004-36),
BX 338||||2||Seed of|Ornithogalum glandulosum, ex Jim Duggan Flower Nursery, the earliest winter flower I grow,
BX 338||||3|||Small tubers|Alocasia hypnosa, a recently described (2005) species from China. Big light green leaves that give a tropical look to a shady area. Winter dormant. I store the big tubers in a bucket of dry sand in a cold garage every winter, but small tubers have over-wintered fine in ground in my 8b garden. I suspect the big tubers would do the same if buried in well-drained soil. They are waking now, so plant right away.

BX 338||||14|Oxalis flava|(pink) -- leaves low to ground, attractive, one year some of the flowers were also yellow (along with the pink), but usually it has pink flowers, no guarantee about the color but the leaves are nice and it doesn't offset a lot
