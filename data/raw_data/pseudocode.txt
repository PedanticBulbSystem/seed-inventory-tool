for each i in list such as 320 thru 340
do

bx_id = i

readign should begin with the first donor, as in "From First Last:"

but sometimes there's extra text there. Shoot.

if simple,...

read donor

while read nextline not starting with "From "...
do

read item_no as all digits until first .
once so far there was a , for . typo but lets assume it is ok

discard the ". "
Take that string from there to its end.

rawstring = all after "\d*\. "

sometimes this string wraps. Big headache.
For now... just process the non-wrappers.

If it wraps, it usually does not start the next line with digits.
If nextline not starting with "\d*\. "
then concatenate it onto the end of rawstring.
Keep doing that til hit digit at start of line.

Gather that data for later processign step.

done loop


Next: process rawstring

Need to:
* extract taxon
* extract seeds/bulbs category
* extract winter/summer growing... may be too difficult
* remove "Seed of " or "Bulbs of " once category is set
* if special like rhizome/tuber/corm or cormlets, bulblets, offsets, keep that in comment string
* how to separate taxon when it is not simply "Genus species"?

maybe mostly scripted but with human clean-up later step

* look for http/https links and put those into photo_link
*  how to handle when there is a comment that applies to all items in a section?

Ugh
