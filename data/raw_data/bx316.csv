"BX 316","BULBS",2,"Crinum bulbispermum 'Wide Open White' x C. 'Spring Joy'","Jay Yourch","from crosses which I made in 2006. Their flowers are variable, showing the diversity of genes present in their parents. They should be very cold hardy, likely doing well into zone 6. They start flowering before any other Crinum in my garden, usually April here in central North Carolina, although they got started in March this year and continued into June. There are bulbs with white flowers and bulbs with pale pink flowers, and they are labeled.hey are labeled."
"BX 316","BULBS",3,"Crinum pedunculatum","Jay Yourch","Fairly tender, Zone 8, but does well in colder areas if grown in a large container and protected from freezing temperatures. A greenhouse is not required, my spends each winter in a cool garage (above freezing) and looks nearly as good in early spring as it did the previous autumn. While I enjoy its spidery, white flowers, Isenjoy its architectural foliage even more."
