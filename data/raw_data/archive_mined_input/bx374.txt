From Uli Urban:
7. Seeds of Scadoxus sp.;? My Scadoxus plant came from a plant sale in a Botanical Garden in Germany where they had an old plant of amazing size in a very large tub, this plant was full of spent flowers and must have looked magnificent when it was in flower. Unfortunately there was no name on the plant.  They said the seedlings they were selling came from this plant. It flowered for the very first time last year, I handpollinated the flowers and got a handful of berries. It could be the old Hybrid 'King Albert'
