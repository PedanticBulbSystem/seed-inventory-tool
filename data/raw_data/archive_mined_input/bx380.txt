From Uli Urban:
1. Lachenalia punctata (syn. L. rubida) bulbili. The plant is quite showy with red tubular flowers in early spring and is strictly winter growing.  The bulbili form at the leaf bases and on the midrib like structure of the leaf.The mother plant was given to me by Dietrich Müller-Doblis but I do not have the collection data.
2. Gladiolus flanaganii cormlets and small corms. It grows very vigorously with me but is a little shy to flower, easy, summer growing and winter dry.
3. Tropical waterlily Tubers of my blue tropical waterlily. I posted those before. I lost the mother tubers in winter due to rot but the small tubers that formed in the center of the leaves were kept in moist Sphagnum with some fungicide at a temperature around 10°C.  They kept very well, I started 2 of them at the end of April and all sprouted. I had kept one in unheated water in my frost free but cold greenhouse. It is sprouting, too. They should be started immediately in warm water, give them as much light and warmth as possible, fertilize well (Osmocote is best) and then they will grow VERY quickly.  Purple-blue flowers with yellow centre held above the water, very scented. Will form new tubers or even small plants on the leaves (viviparous) Identity is uncertain, I got it as an exchange from the Strasbourg Botanical Garden in France under the name of Nymphaea daubeniana which it is definitely not. It comes closest to the Hybrid 'Tina'
From Rimmer de Vries:
4. Cyclamen graecum fresh seeds moist packed in vermiculite.
5. Clivia miniata hyb; Seeds of hyb- ex Maris Andersons- blooms as Salmon D4 to Apricot D6 (VERY FEW)
