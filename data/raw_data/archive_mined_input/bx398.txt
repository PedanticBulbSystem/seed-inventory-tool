From Rimmer de Vries:
1. yellow Clivia sp.: 1 yr old seedings (VERY FEW) These are all Type 1 yellow clivia- that means they always make yellow seedlings no matter what pollen parent you use. The pale yellow flower flower is rather large and loose.
2. yellow Clivia sp.:   3 yr old seedlings  (FEW) These are all Type 1 yellow clivia- that means they always make yellow seedlings no matter what pollen parent you use. The pale yellow flower flower is rather large and loose.

From Uli Urban:
8. Tubers of Spathantheum orbignyanum; a deciduous Aroid from Bolivia. It is incredibly prolific. This plant produces large leaves in summer similar to those of Acanthus. The flowers appear before the leaves and look like a long-stemmed thin leaf, only if you look at the underside one will see it is in fact a flower. The smell is strange, not on the pleasant side.... It likes full sun and lots of water and fertilize when in growth and takes a totally dry rest in winter, easy to grow.
9. Bulbili of "Lachenalia rubida var. bulbifera". A nice and easy to grow plant, the bulbili are fresh and were harvested today. It is a winter growing plant with early spring flowers.
From Ralph Carpenter:
10. Seeds of Hippeastrum vittatum
11. Seeds of Hippeastrum blossfeldiae
