From Nhu Nguyen:
Codes: W = winter growing, Sp = spring/summer growing, S = summer growing,
WC = wild collected, OP = open pollinated, CP = control pollinated
SEEDS:
1. Lilium parvum - Sp WC, Nevada Co., CA about 5000ft (1500m), stratification recommended. 
2. Lilium sp. (washingtonianum?) - Sp WC, Nevada Co., CA about 3500ft (~1000). I found this only in seed so no guarantee of the actual species, but based on location and elevation, it could very well be L.  washingtonianum. Stratification recommended although probably not necessary.
3. Calochortus luteus NNBH2503 - W WC, Calaveras Co., about 650ft (200m). From a friend's property. This form is supposed to have a nice and dark marking in the center.
4. Bomarea acutifolia - OP this species comes from Mexico and Central America. It likes to be slightly warmer than other species of Bomarea but grows fine in the Bay Area. This species can grow year-round in moderate winter areas, although much slower in winter and more vigorous in spring and summer. It is said that the seeds cannot dry out completely so I packed them into barely moist peat for distribution. NOT RECOMMENDED for Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia and other areas prone to invasive plants. These produce beautiful red seeds that are easily dispersed by birds, thus can spread.
5. Allium dichlamydeum - W OP
6. Allium hyalinum pink - W OP
7. Allium sanbornii - W OP
8. Dichelostemma multiflorum - W OP
9. Lachenalia aloides v. aurea - W OP
10. Cyrtanthus brachyscyphus - W CP
11. Ornithogalum fimbrimarginatum form (Steve? Hammer) - W CP
12. Gladiolus alatus - W CP
13. Nerine bowdenii - W OP
BULBLETS:
14. Hippeastrum striatum - S seed grown, very vigorously offset forms mixed together so there is a good chance that you will get a multiple clones from several bulblets.
15. Allium unifolium - W always a nice and reliable onion that blooms midspring and multiplies slowly but steadily.
16. Allium amplectens - W
From Kathleen Sayce: SEEDS
17. Diplarrhena moraea, parent is white flowered, selfed (no other Diplarrhenas for males)
