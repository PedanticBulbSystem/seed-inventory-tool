ALL BULBS:
[Our kind friend Marilyn Pekasky of the UC Berkeley Botanical Gardens voluntarily performs the thankless task of trying to verify the names of items offered on the BX. In the case of the genus Narcissus this has proved nearly impossible. So I have decided to go with the names that were provided by our very knowledgeable donor Roy Herold.]

15. Narcissus Mixed Seedlings These date back to a mass sowing in 2004 of seed from moderately controlled crosses of romieuxii, cantabricus, albidus, zaianicus, and similar early blooming sorts of the bulbocodium group. Colors tend to be light yellow through cream to white, and flowers are large, much larger than the little gold colored bulbocodiums of spring. These have been selected three times, and the keepers are choice. Similar to my 2012 PBS offering.
