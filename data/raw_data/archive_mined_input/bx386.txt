From Denis Kramb:
18. Sinningia eumorpha 'Roxa Clenilson' (small tubers, purple variant of Sinn. eumorpha, recently discovered in the wild by Clenilson Souza of Brazil, "roxa" is Portuguese for "purple", the name "Roxa Clenilson" is not a registered name, but just a descriptor for the discoverer & color variant.)
19. Sinningia cardinalis (small tubers, most of them roughly pea-sized or smaller, should be planted & watered once, new growth should happen quickly)
20. Sinningia cardinalis (few, large tubers, recently bloomed this summer, may require a period of dormancy before resprouting, or might re-sprout immediately)
21. Sinningia 'Deep Purple Dreaming' (few, large tubers, these were harvested when fully dormant, but this cultivar has a long dormancy for me, so plant immediately but water sparingly until new growth naturally resumes)

23. Small bulbs of Gethyllis sp.?, ex Silverhill
