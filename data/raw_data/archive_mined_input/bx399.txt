From Monica Swartz:
8. Small bulbs of Drimia haworthioides: ex Huntington Botanic Gardens Collection #49314, this fun and easy plant has bulb scales that look like the leaves of a Haworthia when planted at the surface, then it grows fur-edged leaves in winter (they should be dying back now). One of my most requested plants. Doesn't mind year-round water with good drainage. Seems quite freeze hardy in my 8b climate but I have yet to try it in the ground. If one of the loose scales falls off, it will make bulblets on its edges if lightly buried.
9. Small bulbs of Cyrtanthus mackenii ex Buried Treasures, yellow or orange flowered
From Dell Sherk:
10. Small bulbs of Hippeastrum vittatum
