From Nicholas Plummer:
9. Seeds of Arisaema triphyllum - these are seeds from plants grown in my garden and are two generations removed from seed originally collected in Wake Co, NC. I usually observe good germination after cold, moist stratification.
10. Seeds of Lilium formosanum - these are the tall standard variety originally purchased from Niche Gardens. They were pollinated by moths in the open garden, but I did not have any other Lilium species blooming at the time. I think the chance of hybrids is minimal. These plants volunteer readily, so I have never attempted controlled germination. Consequently, I do not know what percentage of seeds are viable.
