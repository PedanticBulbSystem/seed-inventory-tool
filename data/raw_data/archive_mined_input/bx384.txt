6. Seed of Habranthus robustus - Telos, . https://flic.kr/p/xmZDVu/ -short lived seed
7. Seed of Habranthus sp.? came as something else in BX 316 #16- i listed this as H. robustus on the seed packet but i have been told this is not the correct name. these are big plants with big flowers and like lots of water. This is seed from the same plants as BX 382 #15. Please note the correction. These were hardy in a cold frame in Michigan for several years but the plants really took off when I brought the pot inside. Big pink flowers flowers everytime it rains all summer. here is a link to photos of the plant and flowers. https://flic.kr/s/aHskhHDZN9/ -short lived seed.
