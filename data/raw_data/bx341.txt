From Nhu Nguyen:
KEY: S = summer growing, W = winter growing, OP = open pollinated, CP = control pollinated
SEEDS:
1. Albuca spiralis - [W, OP] this plant selfs and there were no other Albuca blooming at the same time.
2. Albuca sp. Willowmore (pod) x Augrabies Hills (pollen) [W, CP] - tentatively identified as forms of Albuca polyphylla 
3. Albuca sp. Willowmore (pollen) x Augrabies Hills (pod) [W, CP] - tentatively identified as forms of Albuca polyphylla 
4. Babiana "longituba" [W, OP] 
5. Gladiolus splendens [W, OP] 
6. Gladiolus quadrangularis [W, OP] 
7. Gladiolus alatus [W, OP] 
8. Geissorhiza radians [W, OP] 
9. Geissorhiza corrugata [W, OP] 
10. Geissorhiza aspera [W, OP] 
11. Sparaxis elegans [W, OP] 
12. Sparaxis tricolor [W, OP] 
13. Hesperantha bachmannii [W, OP] no other Hesperantha were blooming at the same time 
14. Massonia pustulata NNBH905 [W, OP] originally from Paul Cumbleton, BX181, described as having very few pustules 
15. Massonia aff. pustulata NNBH786 [W, OP] originally from Roy Herold, BX174 
16. Lachenalia ensifolia (syn Polyxena pygmaea) [W, OP] 
17. Rauhia multiflora [S, CP] 
18. Calochortus umbellatus [W, OP] 
19. Triteleia lugens [W, CP] 
20. Delphinium nudicaule [W, CP] these seeds should be pure
21. Lewisia brachycalyx [W, CP] 
22. Fritillaria affinis robust x normal form [W, CP] - we had a discussion about the robust form before that it may be a triploid. However, it crossed just fine with a regular form, from a different location, so I don't think it's a triploid. The seedlings should be an interesting mix of sizes and colors.
