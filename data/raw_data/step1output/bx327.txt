From Guy L'Eplattenier:
||1||Seed of| Lapiedra martinezii|"I grow them in my garden at El Perelló, Cataluña, spanish med. coast, but they come from along the road to Cabo de La Nao, Javea, Provincia de Alicante, where they grow in clumps under Pinus Halepensis. ( they also grow in full sunshine in the cliffs next to the sea, but more one by one)I have them here half shade under the same pine trees and little by little they form a nice group of 20/30 bulbs now.They naturalize and I put more in various places.They have nice dark green leaves with a silvery midrib, they disappear beginning of the summer and white stary flowers begin blooming end of the summer ( same time as Urginea Maritima) , then rapidly form black seeds to get them ready for the october rains.They are highly drought resistant , wind resistant, salt resistant and cold resistant till -5 celsius... but maybe on the dry side... quite an interesting jewel for mediterranean gardens, in fact. Seeds do germinate easily."
