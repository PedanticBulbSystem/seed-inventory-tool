Pseudocode for parser

loop thru bx_id_year_month.csv
which has these two columns:
400:2016-June
401:2016-August
401:2016-June
402:2016-June
403:2016-June
404:2016-July
405:2016-August
406:2016-August
407:2016-August
408:2016-August

that are sorted alpha, not by month order :(

for each BX number,

open that all.txt in the subdir of this pattern:
pbsarchive/2016-June/all.txt

while read

when hit this sequence:

From: Dell Sherk <ds429@frontier.com>^M
Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 400^M
Date: Fri, 3 Jun 2016 14:19:40 -0400^M

That is, when hit
"Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 4[0-9][0-9]"
right after hitting Dell or Albert's From

parse out the BX ID number

Then go to a function named read_bx()

The writing out will happen from within that function.

Continue with current file to its EOF

Continue with loop thru filenames to that EOF

end

Now, that read_bx() function:


echo to the Collector file a separator and the BX ID number, like
BX#444 -=============================


Keep reading from the same input ... 
is that global? Test that.

until hit a line starting with 
"^From [A-Z][^:]*"

then start echoing the lines, verbatim, to the Collector.

Problem: sometimes it says 'all seeds' or 'all bulbs' even before the first From line.
