Plants form basal offsets.  Blooms a week so before the glaucous H. harrisiana (offered by Dutch importers) that has wider tepals. Blooms a full month before the H. leavenworthii offered by Telos (which looks similar but blooms 4-5 weeks later).  Flowers similar to those pictured in the PBS wiki  http://pacificbulbsociety.org/pbswiki/index.php/Hymenocallis However, leaves and flowers do not match the original description published in (Plant Life 38: 41, 1982) which describes linear or strap like leaves, a flatter staminal cup and narrower tepals. also leaves are much shorter than the 3 foot tall leaves described on the Plant Delights Perennial Encyclopedia for Hymenocallis maximiliani http://www.plantdelights.com/Hymenocallis-maximiliani-for-sale/Buy-Maximilians-Spider-Lilies/ .  perhaps a new species or a Mexican Alliance hybrid, (the hymenocallis section needs work)

::ttrue------402---------From Rimmer De  Vries:
::ttrue------402---------"Bulbs" 
::ttrue------402---------1. Notholirion thomsonianum,  ex Illhea Bulbs  - basal bulblets.
::ttrue------402---------2. Gloxinia sylvatica /Seemannia sylvatica ( Bolivian sunset )- rhizomes, plant 1" deep  each piece will become a new plant
::ttrue------402---------3. Othonna sp. possibly Othonna aff. perfoliata ex Mike Vassar 7454, Simonsviel-  yellow florets with no petals.  good increaser in damp sand in later fall  to winter- dry summer
::ttrue------402---------Seed:
::ttrue------402---------4. Phaedranassa sp., ex BX 335 came as P. tunguraguae - cross between sister seedlings.  
::ttrue------402---------5. Cyclamen hederifolium, mix of many types 
::ttrue------402---------From Uli Urban:
::ttrue------402---------6. Tubers of Begonia falciloba
::ttrue------402---------7. ONE corm of Gladiolus sericeo-villosus
::ttrue------402---------8. Seed of Thunia marshalliana Thunia marshalliana is a terrestrial orchid which can be grown 
::ttrue------402---------exactly like a geophyte. It needs a warm and sunny place in summer (I 
::ttrue------402---------grow it in the greenhouse in hot conditions) in the open if it is warm 
::ttrue------402---------and humid enough. Lots of water and fertilizer, the reed like plant 
::ttrue------402---------becomes quite big. clusters of big white flowers on top of the cane. 
::ttrue------402---------Totally dry winter dormancy. I repot every year as the roots are also 
::ttrue------402---------dying off in winter. After the shoot has emerged in spring about 1 or 2 
::ttrue------402---------inches long everything is taken apart, the 2-year-old dried up 
::ttrue------402---------pseudobulb and dead roots cut off and last year's very turgid pseudobulb 
::ttrue------402---------with the emerging shoot is planted. Compost rich in humus with some 
::ttrue------402---------amount of powered clay added, lots of water and fertiizer. Dry rest 
::ttrue------402---------after the leaves start to fall.  Orchid seed is for the specialist, it 
::ttrue------402---------normally needs either the symbiosis with the fungus from the mother 
::ttrue------402---------plant's soil to germinate or artificial lab sowing on synthetic Agar 
::ttrue------402---------under sterile condition. I have never done this. Some Orchid seed can 
::ttrue------402---------germinate like ordinary seed but I do not know if Thunia will do so.

::ttrue------412---------22.   Seeds of Amaryllis belladonna, dark pink (FEW)
::ttrue------412---------From Uli Urban:
::ttrue------412--------- 
::ttrue------412---------23.   Begonia gracilis var martiana. BULBILS They look like seed but are miniature tubers which are produced in large numbers on the nodes. They should not dry out completely but best "sown" now in a small pot and kept just a little moist from time to time. They will eventually sprout fairly late in May or June, flower the second year. Beautiful upright plant to 75cm tall with large slightly fragrant pink flowers. fully dormant in winter, prone to mildew in autumn.
::ttrue------412--------- 
::ttrue------412---------24.   Seeds of Clivia miniata 'Belgian Strain' In the family for well over hundred 
::ttrue------412---------years.... This is the broad leaved and large flowered form. I grow 
::ttrue------412---------another more dainty form with narrow leaves and smaller flowers from 
::ttrue------412---------another branch of the family.... as old. Easy but slow from seed. (FEW)
::ttrue------412--------- 
::ttrue------412---------25.   Cyrtanthus labiatus, not flowered for me so far, fleshy bulbs above 
::ttrue------412---------ground, produces lots and lots of bulbils. From the M"uller-Doblies 
::ttrue------412---------couple. Identity is certain.
::ttrue------412--------- 
::ttrue------412---------26.   Cyrtanthus sp. or Strumaria sp.. Same type of bulb, fleshy above ground, even 
::ttrue------412---------more bulbils, no flower as well. Identity is not certain, so far 
::ttrue------412---------unflowered. From John Lavranos.
::ttrue------412--------- 
::ttrue------412---------27. Seeds of Scadoxus multiflorus subsp katharinae.  From Essen Botanical Garden, they 
::ttrue------412---------have a most impressive giant specimen in a huge tub and sell young 
::ttrue------412---------seedlings. Slow at first but worth the patience. Big red flower heads in 
::ttrue------412---------spring. Not fully dormant in winter with me, makes a flush of new 
::ttrue------412---------stemmed foliage in spring.
::ttrue------412--------- 
::ttrue------412---------28. Nymphaea sp., tropical blue viviparous. Forms small leaf tubers at the end 
::ttrue------412---------of the season when the water gets cooler. These LEAF TUBERS can be 
::ttrue------412---------stored in moist sphagnum, I treated them with a whiff of fungicide 
::ttrue------412---------before posting, Leaf tubers are much easier to store than adult tubers. 
::ttrue------412---------Start in spring in a heated aquarium with extra light and plant into a 
::ttrue------412---------warm pond or large container in full sun when spring weather has warmed 
::ttrue------412---------up, late May or early June with me. Feed with Osmocote, this does not 
::ttrue------412---------trouble the water. I have had better results storing the adult potted 
::ttrue------412---------tubers with almost all the foliage cut off. Stood in a large bucket in a 
::ttrue------412---------frost free greenhouse in unheated water it made almost no growth until 
::ttrue------412---------the days got longer and the temperature rose. Adult tubers stored in 
::ttrue------412---------sphagnum ALWAYS rotted. Beautiful purplish-blue flowers above the water, 
::ttrue------412---------exquisitely scented.

::ttrue------416---------Bulbs:
::ttrue------416---------1. Achimenes 'Pink Cloud' - from earlier BX, originally was soft pink; later years a bright pink appeared in the middle of the soft pink
::ttrue------416---------2. Gloxinella lindeniana - from earlier BX
::ttrue------416---------3. Oxalis sp. Mexico - summer growing - originally from Uli Urban
::ttrue------416---------http://www.pacificbulbsociety.org/pbswiki/index.php/MiscellaneousOxalis#sp
::ttrue------416---------4. Tigridia pavonia 'Sunset in Oz' - bulbs grown from seed with this name
::ttrue------416---------5. Zantedeschia 'Blaze'
::ttrue------416---------From Dennis Kramb:
::ttrue------416---------6. Rhizomes of Achimenes  'Rosy Frost'
::ttrue------416---------7. Rhizomes of Achimenes  'Summer Sunset'
::ttrue------416---------From Rimmer de Vries:
::ttrue------416---------8. Haemanthus albiflos seedings 2 yrs old (FEW)
::ttrue------416---------9. Haemanthus pauculifolius seeds  (VERY FEW)
::ttrue------416---------From Uli Urban:
::ttrue------416---------10. Achimenes patens. These are stem bulbils which are much smaller than normal rhizomes and therefore easier to ship. They would benefit from an overnight soak in lukewarm water before planting. The plant itself becomes fairly big, best in a hanging basket. Has a long vegetative period. Large showy purple flowers.
::ttrue------416---------11. Arisaema consanguineum 'The Perfect Wave ' and 'Wild Blue Yonder' mixed small tubers. Both are offsets from the original plants, selected by Ellen Hornig. Very beautiful and good performers. Hardy but pot grown with me, performance is better this way. Thanks again to Ellen for sharing these many years ago.
::ttrue------416---------12. Arisaema tortuosum, small tubers. Can become very big, mine are seed grown and have flowered and made offsets for the first time last summer. Pot grown and not tested for hardiness.
::ttrue------416---------13. Small corms of Gladiolus cruentus. Summer growing but has a long growing cycle and flowers late in the season, sometimes spoiled by bad weather. Multiplies well.
::ttrue------416---------14. Gladiolus dalenii 'Boone' a straightforward and easy summer grower. The interesting thing about this form is that it has branching inflorescences.
::ttrue------416---------These are very small bulbils for obvious reasons. Sometimes they do not sprout, this can be overcome by soaking them overnight in lukewarm water with a small amount of dish washing liquid. This helps the water to penetrate the hard shell to break dormancy.
::ttrue------416---------15. Sauromatum horsfieldii, a small and charming plant except for its flowers. They do not smell like rotten meat like most of the family does but their smell seems fairly inoffensive first but is very irritating on the long run. The charm is the foliage: dense low (max 25cm) shining velvety green with some patterns. Best in partial shade. Multiplies rapidly so better keep an eye on it. Mine are pot grown and not yet tested for hardiness.
::ttrue------416---------16. Sauromatum or Typhonium giganteum: Deep blackish purple spathes before the leaves, I did not notice any offensive smell (no guarantee given). Elegant shiny bright green leaves, arrow shaped appear very late in the season. Not tested for hardiness, full sun.
::ttrue------416---------17. Scadoxus multiflorus. Few seeds only. I had a big infructescense but unfortunately was not aware they would germinate inside the berry if left for too long. I had to sow the germinated seeds for myself. Summer growing, easy, big plants with big red flower balls.
::ttrue------416---------18. Spathantheum orbignyanum. Summer growing Bolivian Aroid with big tubers. Flowers before the leaves. Strange smell. Lush foliage a little like Acanthus. Many people mistake the flowers for thin leaves, the true flowers are arranged toothbrush like UNDER the spathe and not visible from above. Multiplies well, definitely not hardy.
::ttrue------416---------19. Last but not least a few leaf tubers of my lovely blue waterlily  (Nymphaea sp.) I wrote an article for the bulb garden on them so will only say: start them now in 25 deg centigrade warm water with maximum light and plant into a warm pond once the weather in your climate gets warm.

::ttrue------429---------1. Sinningia cardinalis "Innocent"
::ttrue------429---------2. Sinningia cardinalis
::ttrue------429---------3. Sinningia "Peridots Sand Pebbles"
::ttrue------429---------"The cardinalis were approaching their natural dormancy.  They should be only lightly watered until growth resumes, which could take a couple months.  The "Peridots Sand Pebbles" were in rampant growth & will probably grow vigorously immediately once repotted.  To my knowledge this hybrid never goes dormant (probably inherited from its Sinningia bullata ancestry).
::ttrue------429---------They are all bloom-sized & range from 2 to 6 years old.  I STRONGLY recommend wide shallow pots for these.  I had some planted in narrow deep pots and struggled tremendously extricating them this weekend.  The small pots caused their shapes to be malformed, too.  I think they'll approach normal shape again in a few years in good conditions."
