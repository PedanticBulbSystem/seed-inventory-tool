notes

Strange: 
but extractor.sh only finds BX 401 thru 413, and not 404, 411, or 412.

Because for those missing cases, Dell's From: line differed.

From: ds429 <ds429@frontier.com>
Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 404

or

From: <ds429@frontier.com>
Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 411

vs

From: Dell Sherk <ds429@frontier.com>
Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 405

So I need to loosen the From: finder.

And I need to further tighten that the next line has to be

Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 4

function grab {
    echo "hello";
}


how to escape missing end of a bx

 Greetings,
   I've previously offered
 to help in updating the tech side of the BX - but I think  Dell, already at the limit of his capacity for this  enormous, ongoing effort, preferred to keep things as they  are. Here are a few ideas:
   1) I presume Dell keeps an
 inventory document (such a spreadsheet). We could use this  document to populate an online ordering page where, rather  than sending emails to place orders, people could instead  place their orders online. That system could track inventory  and automatically remove items that were spoken-for.
 ...
 I would be happy to help
 engineer a system like this.

 In reply, Dell mentions the physical handling takes the most time.
 =====================
 
After running dell_style_extractor.sh on no_empty_lines.txt
you need to filter out just the ::ttrue lines.

 
But there is a problem with wrapped lines. 
I cannot use J in vi if there is that stuff in front of the line. 
And I cannot filter that stuff out w/o losing the bx_id.
406---------26. Narcissus Mixed Seedlings
406---------These date back to a mass sowing in 2004 of seed from moderately
406---------controlled crosses of romieuxii, cantabricus, albidus, zaianicus, and
406---------similar early blooming sorts of the bulbocodium group. Colors tend to be


--------- post-processing --------------


grep ^::ttrue al_style_extracted.txt > al_just_items.txt
grep ^::ttrue dell_style_extracted.txt > del_just_items.txt

cat al_just_items.txt | sed 's/::ttrue------/BX /' | sed 's/---------/|/' > foo
mv foo al_just_items.txt

cat del_just_items.txt | sed 's/::ttrue------/BX /' | sed 's/---------/|/' > foo
mv foo dell_just_items.txt


Then did the step I used to do with vi and J
instead inside oXygen
to wrap long comments (remove line feeds]


in oXygen, replaced multi-space with single-space

in vi do
BX 402|8.
from Uli, of course. :]


do need to handle
" var. "
in taxa. 23 of those in dell_just_items.txt
Too tedious to process manually.

BX 435 was sent from Al's iPhone and has forwarding marks.
heads up for irregular pattern matching.

prelim grep says 639 items in AS era, 438 thru 462.

DS 401 thru 437, grep finds 414 two-digit plus 302 one-digit = 616 total.

Those found during the search/replace for item numbers not ending in a decimal before the space.
:]


--------- post-processing --------------

cat al_just_items.txt | sed 's/.$//' > lf_al_just_items.txt
cat dell_just_items.txt | sed 's/.$//' > lf_dell_just_items.txt

because my parser needs the lines to be LF not CRLF terminated.


------------- to process taxa with var. ----------------

In this set above 4 hundred, 
this regex
 var. ([a-z]*)
matches 34 out of 34 test lines. Bingo.

 [A-Z][a-z]* [a-z]* var. ([a-z]*)
matches 31 of the 34.
where of the 3 misses, 2 were correct-misses.
The only one it really missed was:
BX 406|21. Narcissus romieuxii subsp. albidus var. tananicus N002

and I think the subsp. are not handled yet anyway.


future wish-list for parser:

BX 403 14. Oxalis obtusa 'Peaches & Cream'
BX 403 18. Oxalis purpurea 'Lavender & White'
BX 437 5. Crinum 'Milk & Wine' bulbs

Genus sp. 
so many of those! Next time...

Dell always put a : in the From line. Al didnt. My parser was too tuned to Dell's :
