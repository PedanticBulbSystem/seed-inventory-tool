notes

Strange: 
but extractor.sh only finds BX 401 thru 413, and not 404, 411, or 412.

Because for those missing cases, Dell's From: line differed.

From: ds429 <ds429@frontier.com>
Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 404

or

From: <ds429@frontier.com>
Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 411

vs

From: Dell Sherk <ds429@frontier.com>
Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 405

So I need to loosen the From: finder.

And I need to further tighten that the next line has to be

Subject: Pacific Bulb Society BX 4

function grab {
    echo "hello";
}


how to escape missing end of a bx

 Greetings,
   I've previously offered
 to help in updating the tech side of the BX - but I think  Dell, already at the limit of his capacity for this  enormous, ongoing effort, preferred to keep things as they  are. Here are a few ideas:
   1) I presume Dell keeps an
 inventory document (such a spreadsheet). We could use this  document to populate an online ordering page where, rather  than sending emails to place orders, people could instead  place their orders online. That system could track inventory  and automatically remove items that were spoken-for.
 ...
 I would be happy to help
 engineer a system like this.

 In reply, Dell mentions the physical handling takes the most time.

After running dell_style_extractor.sh on no_empty_lines.txt
you need to filter out just the ::ttrue lines.

 
But there is a problem with wrapped lines. 
I cannot use J in vi if there is that stuff in front of the line. 
And I cannot filter that stuff out w/o losing the bx_id.
