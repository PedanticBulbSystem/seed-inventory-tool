# seed-inventory-tool
Made this repo earlier just for trying out some ideas.

Currently everything in this repo has to do with the BX records mining.
1. raw txt files copied from mail list archive
1. parsing scripts
1. postgres bulk upload csv files
1. related bash and sql scripts
1. some dismal failures of my attempt to learn R

Possibly someday in future the components will be:
1. seed inventory back end
1. seed inventory UI for accessions and dispositions
1. bulb/corm/rhyzome/tuber inventory extension to seed inventory
1. seed exchange data model
1. seed exchange UI
1. phenology observation data model
1. phenology observation UI
